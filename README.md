# Jammming
This program is one of the projects for the Codecademy intensive course "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch."
In this project we were tasked with using the JavaScript library React to build an app that would:
- Connect to the Spotify API
- Search Spotify for songs based on a keyword search of song, album, or artist
- Create a playlist of selected songs and save to your Spotify account

## ⚠️ No Longer Functional ⚠️
